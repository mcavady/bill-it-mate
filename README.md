Bill-it-mate - 2015

You can test out the alpha site here http://preview.responsivedeveloper.com/bill-it-mate/

This may change a lot and please do not depend on it being up, it is being developed and will suffer the occasional BORK.


/* bugs and fixes */

- The moving of the site to a preveiw URL was done to test out the migration from server to server while keeping all data. 1 bug found and fixed, in the user login cnotroler.

- Code Notes needed updating and tidying up

- Code author notes and file names added to the top of Models, Views and Conteollers to make things easier to read and find.
